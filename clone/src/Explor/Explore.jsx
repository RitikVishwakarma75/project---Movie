          This project is a full-featured **Netflix clone web application**
          developed to replicate the core functionality and user experience of
          the popular streaming platform, Netflix. It is built with a strong
          emphasis on clean UI design, responsiveness across devices, and
          integration with real-world APIs. <br />
          <br />
          Users can seamlessly browse a wide variety of movies and TV shows,
          view trailers, and access detailed information about each title. A
          custom-built video player mimics the Netflix viewing experience with a
          focus on performance and usability. <br />
          <br />
          The application is powered by **React.js** for building the user
          interface, and **Tailwind CSS** is used to quickly style and organize
          the layout with utility-first design principles. For authentication
          and user management, **Firebase Authentication** is implemented,
          allowing users to sign in, register, and maintain their own
          watchlists. Movie and TV show data is fetched dynamically from the
          **TMDB (The Movie Database) API**, ensuring a rich and constantly
          updated content feed. <br />
          <br />
          The main goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world skills in
          frontend development, API integration, user authentication, and
          responsive UI design. It also showcases the ability to recreate a
          complex, recognizable platform while improving on it with personal
          flair. Whether you're watching a trailer, searching for the latest
          release, or checking cast info, this clone gives you that smooth
          Netflix-like experience ‚Äî all in the browser.
